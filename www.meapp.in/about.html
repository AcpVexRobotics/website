            Mrs. Meyer has coached VEX for 5 years and has watched our teams go to worlds 3 times. 
            She provides us with all the materials we need to build our robots. She is a great support to all ACPO members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Krish started teaching VEX this year. He is in high school and has been a part of the ACPO VEX team when he was younger. 
            He knows a lot about VEX and has gone to worlds several times. He helps provide a great incite about VEX and how to do certain difficult tasks.
            Both of our instructors have helped us out a lot and we hope that they continue to coach teams in the future.

                        <p> This is now my second year participating in VEX and it has been a blast! 
                          Last year I was the builder and driver of my team and I really enjoyed it. 
                          There was so much I learned about design and engineering and I look forward to learning even more.
                          Even though this year, we were not able to participate in the design process as much, I still enjoyed learning how to code in html and making a website.
                          I look forward to continue coding and trying something new this year along with building.
                          Overall, I love VEX and I can't wait for my future years in VEX.

                        I have been in the VEX Robotics competition for 1 year which was the Tower Takeover season of 2019-2020. 
                        I was in team 7830C with my 3 other team members. 
                        I enjoy doing VEX because it is fun because it is competitive and suits my interests. 
                        I am mainly good at coding and was the coder last year on 7830C. 
                        My goal this year in VEX is to go to VEX Worlds and do well.

                        I am 12 years old and this is my second year in Vex. 
                        I like vex because it gives me a chance to experience engineering on a simpler level than if I were to do it with other products. 
                        Last year I was my team's builder and I really enjoyed it.
                        This year I am designing a new piece for vex in the CAD Challenge.
                        I look forward to designing our new vex part in CAD and doing CAD in general.

                          This is my first year in vex and so far, I am loving it!
                          I am currently in the website group for vex and I have been helping with code and web design.
                          In my free time I love to code and play chess. 
                          My favorite coding language is Python, but I know some HTML, C#, and JavaScript. 
                          I hope to have a good first year in VEX!

                            This is my first year in vex and it is really fun!
                            For my first year I have been helping with website information and web design.
                            I also help organize information for the website.
                            So far vex has been very fun and I hope to contine in the future.

                            This is my second year in VEX Robotics.
                            This year I am participating in the CAD Challenge to design a new vex part that would be helpful to all vex teams.
                            I also entered the programming challenge this year.
                            I love coding, VEX, tech, books, violin, and movies. 
                            I hope to continue Vex in the future.

                            This year I have been working with my teammates to build a website. I chose to be on the website team because I enjoy coding.
                            Later on whaen we will be able to attend competitions safely, I would like to be the driver of the team.

                              Though we have not been building robots together due to the pandemic, we participated in the various competitions available.
                              The competition I participated in was the CAD Challenge where we were tasked to make a new part that is usefull for VEX participants.
                              So far I hve been enjoying VEX and I hope I can continue it in the future.

                      <p>(7830A) (2017-2019)</p>
                      <p>If I had to think about what made my time at ACP-Oakland one of the most memorable experiences I’ve had, the first thing that comes to my mind is the ACP-O robotics team. 7830A was my home at ACP. I joined the robotics team in 7th grade, my first year at ACP. </p>
                      <p>The main reason I joined was because I thought it would be cool to be able to build robots. I was one of two sevvies on the team. The other one was Dylan. When our team first started meeting, I was intimidated. I had a little bit of experience in robotics from elementary school, but not much. And I was completely new to the school too. To make it worse, everyone was older than me! But Mrs Meyer and Mrs Moss did a really good job of making sure that no one was ever being left out. </p>
                      <p>My favorite part of the early season robotics was how much I learned. By the time the first semester ended, I could build a small robot all by myself and get it to run! But my favorite part of the robotics club was the tournaments. The tournaments were super long on Saturdays which meant I had to wake up early. But I never regretted it! Every competition was a blast, especially when we won! My favorite moment was probably after we won the last finals match in 7th grade and became tournament champions. We walked back to our table with the robot and everyone was cheering! We were so happy we’d just won the state championship and that happiness lasted for a long time. Just the idea of flying out of state somewhere for a school trip without my parents was so exciting! And I was doing it with some of my closest friends too! I don’t think I could ever forget the ACP robotics club because it was just such a big influence on my life. </p>
                      <p>It sparked my love for robotics, and now robotics is one of the biggest parts of my life! I’m part of an independent vex robotics team now which I actually started up with the other people from my ACP team in 7th grade. I also do FRC Robotics at Hamilton which is more real-world based. I think for those of you who are thinking about joining the robotics team but aren’t sure if you’re “smart enough”, you definitely are. Robotics doesn’t require you to be smart or anything. You just have to be willing to put in the time and you won’t regret it. And the experiences in the club will definitely last a lifetime. </p>

                          Robotics has had a huge impact in my life. 
                          I started robotics art ACP-Oakland in 6th grade, back then it was a team of only 6th graders and one 8th grader. 
                          We were all new but we definitely learned a lot on the way. 
                          I continue to use the skills I learned during my time at ACP like leadership skills, programming, design, and teamwork. 
                          The friends I made during robotics are still my friends now. 
                          In highschool, I continued to do robotics with VEX and started to do FRC with my high school's team. 
                          VEX inspired me at an early age to think creatively and outside the box which eventually sparked my interest in engineering.

                                            (7830C)  (2017-2018)
                                            Junior at Hamilton
                                            My Experience with ACPO’s Vex FRC teams: 
                                            I first joined the Vex Robotics Club at ACP Oakland during my 8th grade year. 
                                            I finally joined in 8th grade because I figured it would be my last chance to do so, or at least junior high. Since 6thgrade, I had always wanted to join, but I never fully made the commitment. 
                                            But I regret not joining sooner.
                                            Since I only had a year left in my junior high career, I was technically a rookie the entire year.
                                            Even so, I was able to participate a lot and it was incredible to think about how much I learned over just that one year.
                                            The friends I had coming into robotics, and those I got to know throughout my time there, also made it so much better.
                                            During that year, I continued to play competitive soccer.
                                            For the season that I also did robotics, my team won a state tournament and we went to a regional tournament over that next summer.
                                            Even though robotics might take up some time, other activities don’t necessarily need to take a back seat. Coming from a more typical sporting background, I was also able to carry skills across the two activities and learn some new skills too.
                                            I absolutely loved my time with the ACP Robotics team and highly recommend it if you are at all interested in creating and designing things yourself.

                                          <p>Sophomore at ACP Erie</p>
                                          <p>My name is Dylan Banhart. 
                                          I attended ACP-Oakland from 6th to 8th grade and was a part of the Vex robotics program all three years.  
                                          When I was in the ACP robotics program I had been on the IQ team for one year and the EDR teams for 2 years. 
                                            My first year in EDR my team, 7830A, had won the state tournament and placed 27th in the qualifying matches of worlds. 
                                            The last year I was in the program I had run the program alongside my teammate Rahil Shah, and three of the teams went to Worlds. 
                                            These 3 years of my life have impacted my life and are still impacting my life as I have joined a team with my three teammates from 7th grade. </p>
                                            <p>These years were the first years that I had been in vex robotics. 
                                            I have learned so much, from teamwork and leadership skills to different robotic structures and mechanisms that can be employed in different situations. Along with that I have gained many friends and connections with interests such as my own. 
                                            Without Acp-Oakland’s robotics program I would have never found my love for robotics, learned leadership skills and made many of the great connections and friends that I have now.</p>

                                            Joining the ACP Oakland robotics team was a truly rewarding experience.
                                            When I first joined the club, I did not have any robotics knowledge, however, by the end of that year, I learned how to program the robot to complete the tasks necessary for the competitions.
                                            Other than robotics knowledge, I also learned a lot about teamwork and how important teamwork is to achieve our goal. 
                                            I truly enjoyed my time on the robotics team at ACP and I really appreciated Ms. Moss’ and Ms. Meyer’s dedication to the robotics team and all the advice they gave us. 
                                            I would highly recommend this club for those who are willing to put in hard work with teamwork to achieve a goal. 
                                            I would also encourage those without any robotics knowledge to also join this club and expand their knowledge on this sector because it is truly beneficial and has many real life applications as well.

                                          (7830A) (2015-2018)
                                          Junior at ACP-Erie 
                                          I was at ACP Oakland for three years, from sixth to eight grade, and joined the Vex robotics program in my first year at Oakland, and did straight for three years. 
                                          When I joined in sixth grade, I had virtually no experience doing any sort of competitive robotics, which was mostly the case with the other members of the team. 
                                          That year we really struggled, missing our first competition because we didn’t have a finished robot, and generally not having much knowledge on how to do things. 
                                          The next year, we built upon the knowledge we had gained the previous year, and built a much better robot, but still faced disappointing results, and went a crushing 0-7 at our third tournament of the season. 
                                          However, we managed to pull through, and at the state tournament that season, we were picked and made it to semi-finals. 
                                          In my final year, we had our best season ever, and pulled in our first award, the Amaze award, at the Microchip tournament, and went on to get tournament champions both at the Erie and state tournaments, the latter of which qualified us for the Vex World Championship, where we placed 27th, after prelim matches. 
                                          Throughout my time in the Oakland robotics program I learned countless valuable skills, like how to deal with disappointing losses and setbacks, and work and cooperate with team members effectively, even under stressful conditions. 
                                          Along the way I met many friends, and made connections, and discovered my love for competition and competitive robotics, all of which I still value to this day.
